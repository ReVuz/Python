'''Suppose a newly born pair of rabbits, one male and one female, are put in a field. Rabbits can mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second month,
a female has produced another pair of rabbits. Suppose that our rabbits never die and that the female always produces one new pair every month from the second month.
Develop a program to show a table containing the number of pairs of rabbits in the first N months.'''
